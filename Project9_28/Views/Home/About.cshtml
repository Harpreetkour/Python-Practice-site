<p> This site will allow faculty members to put up test driven python exercises for beginners which will give them feedback on what is still to be done in the programs. This site will help students to keep track of their own progress in assignments and will help faculty members to solve student’s problems and simplify the grading. As I am designing a site for python programs testing, this site will be very useful for students like “comp 151” students as most of them are usually new to programming. On this site, faculty members will be able to upload the coding assignments, projects for students. In addition to that faculty members will also be able provide test cases for a program. Students will be able to upload the assignment they are doing and check how many test cases it passes and get an idea on where they are in their assignments.</p>
<p>Student will be able to login on this site with their Id and password. The students can upload their programs after making changes or adding something in the code and check the progress. The number of passing test cases will guide the student about his/her assignment situation. Also, description of a failing test case will help student to find out the possible problems and solutions. In addition to this, having such a resource will always help students to have clear idea and right path to avoid misunderstandings about programming assignments (As new computer science students always feel confused about the coding questions).</p>
<p>Faculty members will have the login credentials (ID and password). Every authorized faculty member will have their own space in this application and will be able to upload assignments on this site. Faculty members would be able to upload the assignment statement, test cases, small description about the assignment and about the test cases. The description about test cases will give an idea to students regarding what can go wrong if a particular test case is failing. This will help faculty members to reach out more number of students than solving every problem with students personally.</p>
